## Reasoning for Using AJAX with the fetch API

In this project, I chose to use the fetch API to send AJAX requests, specifically for updating posts via a form submission. Below are the reasons for using fetch over other alternatives like XMLHttpRequest or libraries such as jQuery:

1. Modern and Native Solution
   The fetch API is built into modern JavaScript, making it native to the language and not requiring external libraries. This keeps the project light and reduces dependencies.
   Unlike the older XMLHttpRequest (XHR), which can be cumbersome to work with (especially for handling asynchronous code), fetch is much cleaner and more intuitive with Promises and async/await syntax, providing a better developer experience.
2. Promise-Based Syntax
   The fetch API is Promise-based, which fits well with modern JavaScript and allows for cleaner, more readable asynchronous code. Using async/await makes it easy to handle the response of the request and any errors that may occur.
   This approach avoids the callback hell often encountered with older JavaScript techniques (such as nested callbacks in XMLHttpRequest).
3. Simplified Syntax
   Compared to XMLHttpRequest, the fetch API offers a simpler, more concise syntax. It allows for easier configuration of the request headers, body, and method without needing multiple callback functions or boilerplate code.
   The response is returned as a Promise, which makes it easy to process data once the request completes, reducing the complexity of handling multiple states .
4. Support for JSON by Default
   The fetch API has built-in support for handling JSON data, which is the format expected by the API in this project (JSONPlaceholder). By simply calling .json() on the response object, the response body is automatically parsed into a JavaScript object, making the code simpler and easier to understand.
